		My name is Ryan Bennett and I am 17 years old, currently a year 1 student, studying games design and development at New College Nottingham. Before I joined this course I was studying Graphics design, History and Computing at Kimberley Comprehensive school, which is a secondary school. I also went to Hempshill Hall primary schhol before joining Kimberley Comprehensive school. When I have completed the course I am currently on, I am going to find a job, however I havent got a specific job in mind.

		I have always had a passion for playing video games, I always aim to be the best at whatever I do, always looking for ways I can improve. Knowing that I can become better at something motivates me which is why im always trying to better myself, and this is my attitude to everything in life, not just video games. Theres nothing more satisfying than training hard to become better at something and having that training pay off, feeling like ive got better at something is great to me because I feel like ive used my time and got something good out of it. I hate feeling like I have wasted time when I couldve done something productive with that time.
