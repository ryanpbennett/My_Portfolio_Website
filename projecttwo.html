The game I am currently making in Unreal Engine is a 3D game and based on spatial storytelling. I have designed a two story house and have began to use a variety of textures and design a few objects to go in the rooms. The theme of the game is horror/adventure which is why ive made the inside of the house very dark. This makes the game very intense as being in darkness makes you feel like your not alone, which creates fear and suspense. The story of the game is basically an investigator has gone to a house where a family once lived. The family that lived their had been murdered a few years before and no one has even stepped foot in the house since. The investigators job is to work out exactly what happened to the family.
