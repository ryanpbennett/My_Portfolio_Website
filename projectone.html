The game I made in my first project was 2D and objective-based. The objective in my game is to collect checkpoints throughout 3 different levels, the amount of checkpoints increases throughout the levels. When each checkpoint is collected there is an animation of a coin that floats up to the current score and adds points. When the checkpoints have been collected in each level, the player progresses to the next level. The player will have 3 lives from the start of the game, everytime the player falls off the level or collides with the edges of the platforms, a life is taken away and the current level restarts. When the player loses all 3 of their lives, the game ends. The design of the levels is similar to BRAID. There is multiple platforms on each level and gaps between these platforms. They will also be on seperate levels, which makes getting around the level tricky as the gaps between the platforms can vary. This adds difficulty to my game. I will also use similar game mechanics to BRAID, I am going to have gravity in my game which means that the player could fall between platforms and fall to their death. There is 4 different bits of information in the HUD, How many checkpoints are remaining, how many points you gain by collecting a checkpoint, How many lives are remaining and the players current score. </p></div>
